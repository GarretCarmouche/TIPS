1. Open the project in visual studio code and make sure your path name points to the file like this: PS C:\Users\emgra\School\Spring 2023\capstone\TIPS Repo\TIPS\frontend>
	-if you are not in the right directory use this command: cd pathname
	 for example I used cd frontend to point myself to the front end when building and starting the project
 
2. Then, you are going to want to make sure that you are installing the necessary configurations. Run the following commands mentioned below in your VS Code terminal.

3. Run 
	npm install --version 9.5.0 
   to install the corrent version of npm

4. Then run 
	npm install React-scripts --save
   to install React

5. Then run
	npm install React-router-dom@5.2.0
    to install the routing libraries provided by React

6. Finally run an 
	npm start
   this command will start the project and pull up localhost:3000/ on Google Chrome where you can interact  with the web application*

*if you encounter any errors when trying to start run an 
	npm ci 
 This will deleivers a clean install to the machine. Please contact emma.rader@ttu.edu with any other issues.
